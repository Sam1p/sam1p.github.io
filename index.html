    <h1>Welcome, I'm Sam!</h1>
    <p>I'm a technology lawyer and reformed engineer that's still dabling in code - probably more than I should after catching the innovation bug from the many late night conversations with a young software developer that used to work in our IT department (thank you Ryan). We've since collaborated to either place or win honourable mentions in a number of local hackathons. <a href="/about">Find out more about me</a></p>
