    <h1>Welcome, I'm Sam!</h1>
    <p>I'm a technology laywer and Partner at a leading Canadina law firm, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP. Most importantly, I'm a licensed Professional Engineer with the Professional Engineers of Ontario that's still dabling in code - probably more than I should after catching the innovation bug from the many late night coding sessions with a young software developer that used to work in our IT department (thank you Ryan). We've since collaborated to win a number of local hackathons.</p>
