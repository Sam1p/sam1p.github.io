GPL version 3 ushers in a number of additions to version 2.  While BlackDuck indicates that there is still twice as many open source software licensed under GPLv2.0 (26%) as there are GPLv3.0 (11%), the adoption rate for GPLv3.0 is still increasing.  It&#8217;s worth noting that open source software initially licensed under GPLv2.0 and contains language such as &#8220;or (at your version) any later version&#8221;, would allow users to sublicense their software under either GPLv2.0 or upgrade to GPLv3.0.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GNU Public License (GPL) Version 3.0</strong></span>

**Link to GPLv3.0 License:** [here](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)

**Background:** The GPLv3.0 license is more than twice the length of GPLv2.0.  GPLv3.0 has tightened its language such that it is even more so of a &#8220;legal license&#8221; than the previous GPLv2.0 and introduces new terminology, concepts, and response to recent software developments.

**Key Provisions in GPL 3.0:**

  1. The strong copyleft provisions of ensuring the freedom of open source software is preserved, and the mechanisms for doing so are more/less similar to those provided under GPLv2.0. For a review of GPLv2.0, click: [here](http://www.samuelip.com/?p=336 "Open Source Licenses Series: GPL version 2")
  2. **Protecting against &#8220;Tivoization&#8221;.** There is an emerging trend that hardware manufacturers, such as TiVo, sell hardware containing free software that the end-users can&#8217;t modify because TiVo blocks them from doing so. This is against the spirit of &#8220;free software&#8221; because the manufacturer takes advantage of the the spirit of free software but will not pass on that freedom to its users. GPLv3.0 solves this by requiring the manufacturer provide you with the necessary tools (e.g. access keys, etc.) to modify the GPLv3.0 software.
  3. **Anti-DRM Provisions**. Essentially, these provisions render GPLv3.0 software useless for developing DRM mechanisms. The premise is that people should not be forbidden to write software and tools that they want.  However, against the aforementioned spirit of &#8220;free software&#8221;, certain laws such as the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (a law that implements 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)) criminalizes writing software that circumvents Digital Rights Management (DRM) mechanisms. To combat this, GPLv3.0 states that no work under GPLv3.0 will be considered an &#8220;effective technological measure..under article 11 of WIPO&#8221;, meaning if someone breaks DRM software that contains GPLv3.0 software, then they are not in breach of laws such as the DMCA. In addition, GPLv3.0 also provides that the software developer who implements DRM using GPLv3.0  waives their legal power to forbid circumvention of such technology.
  4. **Protecting Against Discriminatory Patent Deals**. When someone writes or modifies a GPLv3.0 software, others who are conveyed (e.g. distributed, copied) copies are granted a patent license to exercise rights to carry on all activities permitted by GPLv3.0.  This prevents desperate contributors from trying to sue for patent infringement.
