We often hear that the practice of law &#8212; or of any demanding profession, really &#8212; is like a marathon, but maybe this is only half true.

In a marathon, the idea is to run slow and pace yourself so that your stamina will take carry you the entire 42km distance.  Sudden sprints during the marathon will quickly exhaust your energy reserves, putting the race in jeopardy. This strategy works because all participants in a marathon have the opportunity to complete the race.

Unfortunately this isn&#8217;t usually the case with many demanding professions. If you don&#8217;t sprint when you need to sprint, you may never have the opportunity to finish. If you never secure that deal, hit those milestones, or impress the right client, your race could end quite abruptly.  Sometimes it&#8217;s about sprinting hard, recovering, and then repeating; or in running parlance, an interval workout.
