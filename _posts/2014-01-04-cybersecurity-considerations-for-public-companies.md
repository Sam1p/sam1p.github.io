An interesting cybersecurity article I had assisted with has been published in **[Osler&#8217;s Corporate Review](http://www.osler.com/NewsResources/Default.aspx?id=6615)**, and picked up by bothÂ **[Lexology](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d95880eb-fc55-47c6-a10e-a289b32954af)**, and the **[Risk & Compliance Report section](http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/12/04/corruption-currents-from-sacked-uncles-to-price-wars/)** of the online Wall Street Journal. This is a worthwhile read for those following cybersecurity developments by following the links above.
