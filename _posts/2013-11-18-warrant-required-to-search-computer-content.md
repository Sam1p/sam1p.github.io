The Supreme Court on November 7th released their decision [R. v Vu,](http://scc-csc.lexum.com/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13327/index.do "R v Vu") stating that search warrants for specific premises must explicitly grant law enforcement officials the right to search content on computers. Computers, unlike cupboard or drawers on a premises, hold virtually a &#8220;universe of information&#8221; about individuals; information that even individuals themselves may not be aware of, thus giving rise to privacy protections under section 8 of the Charter.

Interestingly, the Court found the charter-infringing conduct not to be egregious and allowed the evidence to be admitted. Thus, strategically, businesses and individuals may wish to consider:

  1. Keeping electronic records on the computer rather than in paper form, thus requiring a judge to weigh whether a more explicit and invasive search-warrant is necessary; and
  2. Encrypting all harddrive data. R v. Vu is an example of how non-egregious charter violations have been overlooked by the court. Thus, even if law enforcement officials erroneously searched your computer, they would not be able to easily decipher the information contained therein.
