Having been called to the Ontario Bar in June, I found the Canadian Bar Association&#8217;s (CBA) publication on  [Legal Trends](http://www.cbafutures.org/cba/media/mediafiles/pdf/reports/trends-isssues-eng.pdf?ext=.pdf) an interesting read. The CBA publication forecasts that:

> With the apparent oversupply of lawyers and stiffer competition from new suppliers, new entrants could be facing a more difficult career path&#8230;Lawyers may continue to work long hours as technology turns the marketplace into a 24/7 operation. (p.32)

While this assessment is caveated with non-conclusory words such as &#8220;could&#8221; or &#8220;may&#8221;, it is essentially the same &#8220;doom and gloom&#8221; message recasted and I want to challenge this notion. No doubt the legal profession is undergoing a radical shift, but I don&#8217;t believe it is as bleak as many say and here&#8217;s why.

It used to be that becoming a lawyer meant having a ticket into the upper-middle class. Many remember those halcyon days of lawyering, but readily forget that the path to become a lawyer was significantly harder back then. Just imagine a young woman (e.g. your grandmother) some two generations ago. If she wanted to become a lawyer, she would first have to possess the determination to pursue this calling despite working on her family farm doing grueling physical labour to make ends meet.  Then, she would also have to buck society trends to postpone marriage as a young lady and complete not only highschool but pursue a university degree and later law school to enter a profession dominated by men.  And once she has become a lawyer, she would have to compete in a sexist culture and face one glass ceiling after another. These are lofty hurdles that, by and large, are diminished today. Thus, in a nutshell, the challenges in establishing a career has not increased with time, but has simply been back-ended.
