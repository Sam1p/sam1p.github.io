I've been burning the midnight oil setting up [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com), having used Wordpress for the past several years, and I'm in *love*.  There's something about the sweet simplicity of drafting blog posts in a word editor, with no frills.  Don't need to deal with the complexity of a content management system and getting back to the basics.

Like most things in life, blogging software doesn't need to do 100 things well with a thousand more bells and whistles - it just needs to do one thing better than every other software, and that's to blog.
