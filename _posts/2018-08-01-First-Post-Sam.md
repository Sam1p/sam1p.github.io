title: "Jekyll: Does One Thing Extremely Well"

I've been completely taken in by [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com), a simple static blogging utility after having used Wordpress for the past several years, and I'm in *love*. Sure, there are plenty of online content management systems that have a thousand bells and whistles, but how many of those features does the average user actually use?  Not many, I'll bet.

There's sweet simplicity in doing one thing, and doing it simply and extremely well.
