The results of the 2013 Ontario Solicitor and Barrister licensing exams were released last week (I passed!).  A few anxious incoming 3Ls have asked about my experience. Reflecting back on the process, here&#8217;s my advice for next year&#8217;s candidates:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /> </strong></span>

  1. **Don&#8217;t believe the rumours that &#8220;everyone passes&#8221; the bar. **This is simply not true.  The Ontario Bar is not a cakewalk, and I know a number of people who have failed.  Sometimes it&#8217;s because of bad luck, but often it&#8217;s because students underestimate how challenging the bar can be.
  2. **Start early.** This is especially true if you have not taken some of the substantive courses covered on the bar exam. The material is dense, and my average pace was approximately 15 pages per hour for new material.
  3. **Understanding the material is crucial.** We had heard stories from upper years that they &#8220;knew a guy&#8221; who just skimmed the materials the night before and passed. While I don&#8217;t know the full circumstances, I can tell you that it can be very confusing to apply the law when you don&#8217;t understand the material. It&#8217;s also extremely puzzling to know where in your index to look when the same term shows up multiple times in different areas of law.
  4. **Don&#8217;t rely exclusively on Indices.** Indices are created by your peers and everyone relies on different trigger words. Make sure you know how the law is laid out in your bar materials so that when the Index fails you, there is a Plan B. I had an extra copy of the Table of Contents always sitting on the desk.
  5. **Glossing over the Ethics section.** While a lot of ethics may appear common sense, they are rooted in principles and ROPC that may be less common sense than you think.  Tactically, Ethics is tested on both the Solicitor and the Barrister exam, so if you study hard for Ethics, you get twice the value. ****

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My Exam Strategy<br /> </strong></span>**Target Timing Per Question :** 1.5 minute per question
  
**
  
Step 1:** Read the question and cross out the ridiculous answers you know are off-mark.  This will be apparent to you if you understand the material.  If I know the answer and I am reasonably confident, I don&#8217;t bother consulting the Bar materials. I check the answer off and bank some time on the clock.

**Step 2:** Consult the Index.  I&#8217;ll look up a maximum of 2 key trigger words. If it shows up, I will flip open my Bar materials to find the appropriate section. If not, proceed to step 3.

**Step 3:** Consult the Table of Contents and find the appropriate section in the Bar materials.  Again, this is where understanding the material really helps.

**Step 4:**  At the 1.5 minute mark, if I still can&#8217;t locate where in the Bar materials the answer is found, I take a guess.  I refuse to stew on a question.  Once you get behind the clock, it is difficult to catch-up.  Moreover, it is easy to get stuck on a difficult question and never get to the easy questions that are within reach.

Good luck to the class of 2014.
