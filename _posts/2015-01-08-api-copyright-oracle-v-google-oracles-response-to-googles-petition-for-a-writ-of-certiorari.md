On December 8th, 2014, Oracle filed its [brief in opposition](https://www.eff.org/document/oracles-brief-opposition-petition-writ-certiori) to Google’s petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of copyright protection for certain Java APIs. Many who have been following the case found it curious that Google petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to consider a different issue than those that were argued before the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit (&#8220;CAFC&#8221;). Undoubtedly, Oracle took notice and wrote in its brief:

> Google poses the question whether the lines of code Oracle authored constitute a &#8220;method of operation&#8221; – and are therefore devoid of all copyright protection – under Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act…In any case, Google never argued to the court of appeals that the lines of code are a &#8220;system&#8221; or &#8220;method of operation&#8221; (p.2).

In my view, I think the Supreme Court of the United States should deny Google&#8217;s petition for a writ of certiorari. Oracle advanced a number of reasons, but perhaps chief among them is simply that the writ of certiorari is not the appropriate vehicle for deciding this issue because:

  1. The CAFC’s judgment is supported by independent rationale not challenged in Google’s Writ of Certiorari. Specifically, copyright subsists in (1) the original declaring code gave rise to copyright; and (2) the package’s creative structure and organization. Even if we accept Google’s lead argument that &#8220;methods of operations&#8221; cannot be copyrighted, such argument could not apply to (2).
  2. The question Google presented to the Supreme Court of United States (whether &#8220;copyright protection extends to…computer software, including a system or method of operation&#8221;) was never made into the CAFC.
  3. This appeal is interlocutory since the CAFC remanded for retrial on whether Google’s copying can be saved on grounds of fair use.

Even if the Supreme Court of the United States decides to grant Google&#8217;s petition for a writ of certiorari, they will have to contend with the fact that, as Oracle relying on Lexmark and Lotus asserts, &#8220;it is generally well-established that code is copyrightable as long as it is&#8230; sufficiently complex and creative to be original.&#8221; Without question, no experienced Java programmer will disagree that the Java APIs are a work of art that meets such criteria. Moreover, the Supreme Court will have to consider in its ruling the far-reaching implications for technological innovation. After all, why would anyone invest time and energy to develop a platform such as Java without the ability to exploit its intellectual property rights for profit?

The implications of this case to Canadian copyright jurisprudence is unclear. The Canadian Copyright Act is not drafted in the same way the American Copyright Act is and does not have the Section 102(a) and (b) dichotomy. Moreover, Canadian courts not affirmed the application of the merger doctrine. For more information about the merger doctrine in Canada, see: Apple Computer Inc. v. Mackintosh Computer Ltd. (1986), 10 CPR (3d) 1, para 27.; Deltirna Corp v. Triolet Systems Inc. (2002), 17 CPR (4th) 289 (Ont. CA), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court refused [2002].
