At Small Claims court, I&#8217;ve encountered ambitious non-lawyer litigants who attempt to conduct his or her own legal research. For those who wish to Do-It-Yourself, I&#8217;ve consolidated some of the most common web resources that I use in my own practice and placed them in the menu tab to the left titled, &#8220;Legal Resources&#8221;.Â  I&#8217;ve also linked to it: [here](http://www.samuelip.com/?page_id=23).

Happy researching!
