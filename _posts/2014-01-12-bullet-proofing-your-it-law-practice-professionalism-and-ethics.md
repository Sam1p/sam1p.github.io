Late last year, I assisted with authoring a summary of a panel discussion on Professionalism and Ethics hosted by the Technology division of the Ontario Bar Association. Â Complex issues were discussed surrounding Limited Scope Retainers and Confidentiality such as:

  * How much knowledge can a Lawyer apply that he or she has garnered from previous transactions? At what point does applying past knowledge become a breach of the confidentiality he or she has established with previous clients?
  * How does a lawyer manage limited scope retainers? For example, how does a lawyer who has been asked to review a subset of a constellation of contracts do so adequately while meeting his or her professional obligations?

While the panel was comprised of technology lawyers, these questions are relevant to lawyers in any practice area. The full summary of the discussion can be found: [here](http://www.oba.org/Sections/Information-Technology-and-E-Commerce-Law/Articles/Articles-2013/December-2013/OBA-Bullet-Proofing-Your-IT-Law-Practice-Professio "Bullet-Proofing your IT Law Practice")
