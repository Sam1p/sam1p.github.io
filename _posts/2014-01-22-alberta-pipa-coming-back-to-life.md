Last year, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the Alberta Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), because it violates a union&#8217;s freedom of expression by restricting a union&#8217;s ability to collect, use or disclose personal information during the course of a lawful strike. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for balance &#8211; specifically, a union&#8217;s constitutional right to freedom of expression must be balanced with the privacy interests protected by the privacy legislation.

On January 14th, the Privacy Commissioner of Alberta published a letter she sent to the Alberta Government.  In the letter, the Privacy Commissioner proposes that the legislative response that:

> &#8230;most directly address the constitutional problem the Court stated would be to **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">add authorizing provisions allowing the collection, use or disclosure of personal information by unions for expressive purposes without consent, in the context of picketing during a lawful strike.</span>**

In essence, the Alberta Privacy Commissioner is proposing a pragmatic and narrow carve-out exemption for unions. Given that Manitoba and British Columbia&#8217;s version of PIPA is substantially similar to Alberta&#8217;s PIPA and would similarly implicate a union&#8217;s freedom to expression in the context of picketing during a lawful strike, I  anticipate the Manitoba and British Columbia legislature will amend their respective privacy legislation in due time.
