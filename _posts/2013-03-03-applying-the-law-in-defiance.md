&#8220;Obiter Dicta&#8221; is Latin for &#8220;Said in Passing&#8221;.  In Common Law jurisdictions where many laws are judge-made, the judicial decisions often contain writing that are non-binding, yet provide clues as to the direction the  law is developing.

I was recently reading _Code 2.0_ by Lawrence Lessig, and was fascinated with one of the phrases he used. He argues that often the judiciary ought to more frequently &#8220;**_apply the law in defiance&#8221;_**.  To be clear, the judiciary would not be usurping the power of the democratically elect.  Rather, the courts could say: &#8220;I&#8217;ve rendered this judgment in accordance with the state of the law, but I don&#8217;t agree with it.&#8221;

As technology and the Internet becomes evermore pervasive in society, we will increasingly discover that applying traditional laws in a cyberspace framework sometimes lead to absurd outcomes (e.g. the whole debacle with Patent Trolls in the Intellectual Property game being one such issue). Often the Parliament is not in a place to decide, and the subject matter can be too technical for the general masses to take a position. As a consequence, Lessig suggests &#8212; and I agree to a great extent &#8212; that courts should still defer to the legislature, but in strong protest.
