Under Canadian contract law (except Quebec), _consideration_ (something of value) must flow both ways in order for a contract to be valid. For example, in a sales contract the buyer would receive the product (consideration) whereas the seller would receive money (consideration). As a result, often one reads a variation of the following in a contract recital:

> <p style="text-align: justify;">
>   NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
> </p>

But by saying insufficient consideration is sufficient, won&#8217;t make it so.  Either there was consideration under the contract, or there was not. Why not just keep contracts simple just say, &#8220;The parties agree as follows:&#8221;?
