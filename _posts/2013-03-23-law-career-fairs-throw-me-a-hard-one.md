This week, I helped represent my law firm at a career fair for law students at my school. Over a hundred first year law students showed up in pristine suits, looking to impress. Only two years ago, I was in their very shoes. Manning the booth for close to 2+ hours and speaking with dozens of students, I started to understand what it was like for interviewers during the law school recruitment process.Â  Too many law students play it too safe.

Interviewers are answering the same questions over and over again. They yearn for challenge, to be delighted from the monotony of parroting the same answers to the very same questions. Make it fun for them, and they just might remember you. Along the way, one might even discover answers to questions everyone else wanted to know, but was too afraid to ask.
