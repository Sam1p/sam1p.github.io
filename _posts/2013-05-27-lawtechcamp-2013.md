lawTechCamp 2013 is here on June 8th. I stumbled on this through a email distribution, and it immediately piqued my interest. Basically, lawTechCamp is a half-day conference on topics that intersect technology and the law.Â  This year, there is a compelling set of talks such as &#8220;[Advising Companies in an Disruption Economy](http://lawtechcamp.com/advising-companies-in-the-disruption-economy/)&#8220;, and &#8220;[The Advantages of Machine Learning](http://lawtechcamp.com/advantages-of-machine-learning/)&#8220;. These seem like quite progressive topics in technology law, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what this is all about.

After some inquiry, Peter MacDonald and Monica Goyal at Fleet Street Law provided me with the discount code: &#8220;student&#8221;

See you there!
