The BSD License 3-Clause  (a.k.a Modified BSD License, New BSD, BSD-3, 3-clause BSD) is another brief license that is &#8220;permissive&#8221; and compatible with the GPL.

**Link to BSD 3-Clause License:** [here](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause "BSD 3-Clause License")

**Background:** The original BSD license contained 4-clauses, but had a problematic &#8220;advertising clause&#8221; which required acknowledgement of organization/individuals that developed the Software.  This became problematic when programs were combined together in a software distribution.  Thus every occurrence of the license with a different name requiring a separate acknowledgement and potentially a full-page ad [chalk-full of acknowledgment](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html)s!  The &#8220;advertising clause&#8221; was therefore removed from the BSD 3-Clause License.  Thereafter an even simpler version of BSD License evolved called the [BSD 2-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) (a.k.a. Simplified BSD License) that omits the &#8220;non-endorsement clause&#8221; that prevented the name of the organization/individual to be used to endorse products derived from the Software.

**Key Provisions in BSD 3-clause License:**

  1. Redistribution of source code must contain the copyright notice, the list of conditions, and the disclaimer found in the license.
  2. Redistribution of binary form (including any documentation and other materials provided with the distribution of the binary form) must also contain the same requirements above in #1.
  3. Software is provided on an &#8220;as is&#8221; basis with no warranties.
